# `removeOtherERC20Tokens` and `takeLockedBNB` methods allow withdrawal of Vesting tokens

## Summary
The Vesting contract allows the administrator to withdraw any ERC20 tokens (or native tokens), including potentially the vesting token itself, through the `removeOtherERC20Tokens` and `takeLockedBNB` function. This capability could be misused to rug the contract by removing all vested tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract contains a `removeOtherERC20Tokens` and `takeLockedBNB` function which is intended to allow the contract administrator to recover any ERC20 tokens mistakenly sent to the contract. However, this function does not exclude the vesting token from being withdrawn. As a result, the administrator could potentially withdraw the vesting tokens, compromising the integrity of the vesting process.

## Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to the total loss of all tokens intended for vesting, effectively rugging participants who are supposed to receive vested tokens over time. This not only impacts the direct users of the contract but could also severely damage the trust and credibility of the project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add a safeguard in the `removeOtherERC20Tokens` and `takeLockedBNB` function that prevents the withdrawal of the vesting token. This can be achieved by adding a requirement that checks if the _tokenAddress is not equal to the address of the vesting token. For example:
```solidity
require(address(token) != _tokenAddress, "Cannot withdraw vesting token");
```
Incorporating this check will ensure that the vesting tokens are secured and cannot be withdrawn by anyone, including the administrator, thus preserving the integrity of the vesting process and protecting the interests of the beneficiaries.
