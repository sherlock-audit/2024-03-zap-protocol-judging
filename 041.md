# Loss of gas yield for protocol across all contracts

## Summary
Blast has the unique implementation of sharing the sequencer fees. Any contract deployed on Blast has the ability to partake in this revenue sharing model. They are reward more, proportionate to the amount of gas the contract has spent.

## Vulnerability Detail
Zap protocol does not have any implementation that interacts with Blast precompile at `0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000002` address.

As a result, default yield mode is VOID and the protocol is unable to change it, and impossible to claim and yield from Blast.

## Impact
Loss of gas yield across all contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a wrapper around all contracts that are interacted with frequently, that allows protocol to set yield mode and claim the yield.
