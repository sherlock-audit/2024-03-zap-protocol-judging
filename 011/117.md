# Initialization functions can be front-run

## Summary
Admin.sol has an initialization function that can be run ahead of time, allowing an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
initialize is a public function and does not have any control access rights, only the settings of _setupRole and _setRoleAdmin. This will cause a very serious problem. Any attacker can seize control of this contract.

### Relevant vulnerability proof:

## Impact
This vulnerability has been discovered by at least a lot of people. Therefore, when the project team deploys the contract call function, there are many enemies, and the probability of being able to outperform different attackers is very low. This is a very high risk.
The control of the contract was seized by the attacker

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Admin.sol#L46-L50

```sol
    function initialize(address _owner) public initializer {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _owner);
        _setRoleAdmin(OPERATOR, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE);
        wallet = _owner;
        platformFee = 2 * (10 ** 17);
        platformTax = 500;

    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
### I think there are three effective measures to solve it:
1.use a factory pattern that will prevent front-running of the initialization,
2.ensure that the deployment scripts have robust protections against front-running attacks.
3.The initialize function sets access control permissions
