# Updating user deposits overwrites existing deposited amount instead of increasing it

## Summary
Users' deposits are not updated but overwritten instead.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the protocol wants to [update user deposits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/c2ad35aa844899fa24f6ed0cbfcf6c7e611b061a/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L53C1-L65C6) there is a simple but major flaw - instead of increasing the existing amount allocated to the user, it is overwritten by the new amount:

```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
        userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
```

The function's name suggests that user amounts should be *updated* instead of pushed/overwritten. This can lead to major losses for a user, simple example:

1. First allocated user deposit amount is 1000 tokens
2. Some time later admins push new deposit amount of 100 additional tokens
3. User's 1000 tokens are overwritten with 100 instead of being added to them
## Impact
Potentially major loss of funds for **multiple** users, so I believe high severity is warranted.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
        userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add instead of overwrite:
```diff
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
-       userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
+       userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit += _amount[i];
```
