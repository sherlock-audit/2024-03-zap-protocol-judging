# No way for vesting contract to receive native funds to pay out to users

## Summary
Vesting contract has no way to receive native funds but has the option to pay out user funds in native.
## Vulnerability Detail
The logic in the function that pays out users' vesting funds [accounts for a scenario](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/c2ad35aa844899fa24f6ed0cbfcf6c7e611b061a/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L83-L84) where if `token == address(1)`, it pays out the funds in native:

```solidity
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
```

But there is no way for the contract to hold native funds. The contract is missing a `fallback()`/`receive()` function, as well as no functions are marked `payable`. This is further illustrated when we take a look at [the function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/c2ad35aa844899fa24f6ed0cbfcf6c7e611b061a/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L53C1-L65C6) which admins use to update user amounts:

```solidity
    function updateUserDeposit(
        address[] memory _users,
        uint256[] memory _amount
    ) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        ...
@>      token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);
    }
```

We can see that there is only logic to transfer in tokens.
## Impact
Vesting contract created with intention to pay out amounts in native cannot hold any native and users will not be able to claim any of their allocated funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add a `receive()` function in the contract that allows it to receive native value.
