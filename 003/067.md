# Vesting.sol::updateUserDeposit Native token cannot be deposited by the admin

## Summary
Vested tokens deposited in the contract can be claimed after some time. The tokens have to be vested beforehand by the admin. There is functionality that supports vesting of native tokens however they cannot be deposited in the first place.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `updateUserDeposit` is not payable so ether cannot be deposited. However in the `claim` function there is logic that explicitly handles the case in which the token is ether `if(address(token) == address(1))`.
## Impact
Native token cannot be properly vested

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the `updateUserDeposit` function by making it payable so that native tokens can be sent to it and add a check that makes sure that `token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);` is only called when the token is in fact an ERC20 token.
