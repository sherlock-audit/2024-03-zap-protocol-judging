# Native tokens cannot be deposited in the Vesting contract

## Summary

The Vesting contract does not have a payable or receive function, so it cannot receive native tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the registered token address in the `Vesting.claim` function is `address(1)`, it is considered to use native tokens. However, since the Vesting contract does not have a payable or receive function, it cannot receive native tokens. That is, even if the token address is set to `address(1)`, there is no way to deposit native tokens.

```solidity
function claim() external {
    ...
    if (pctAmount != 0) {
@>      if (address(token) == address(1)) {
@>          (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
            require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
        } else {
            token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
        }
        s.index = uint128(i);
        s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
    }
}

```

## Impact

Native tokens cannot be deposited in the Vesting contract.

```diff
    function updateUserDeposit(
        address[] memory _users,
        uint256[] memory _amount
-   ) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
+   ) public payable onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        require(_users.length <= 250, "array length should be less than 250");
        require(_users.length == _amount.length, "array length should match");
        uint256 amount;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
            userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
            amount += _amount[i];
        }
+       if(address(token) == address(1)) {
+           require(msg.value == amount, "wrong amount");
+           return;
+       }
        token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);
    }
