# Missing `receive()` function in Vesting contract prevents native ETH from being received

## Summary
The contract cannot function as intended due to a missing `receive()` function, preventing native ETH from being sent to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vesting contract is meant to receive ETH. This can be confirmed by the `claim()` function which sends native ETH from the contract to sender as seen in the line below.

```javascript
(bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}(""); 
```

But the contract is not able to receive ETH to begin with.

## Impact
Vesting contract cannot function as intended.

## Recommendation
Add `receive()` to the contract so that it can receive native ETH.
