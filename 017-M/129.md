# No Sum Invariant check in Vesting::initialize could allow to lock user's tokens

## Summary
Vesting contract utilizes vesting points (a tuple of timestamp,percentage) to regulate token distribution, the sum of all vesting points percentage must be equal to 10_000 ie 100% of tokens.
However this invariant is not checked when setting vesting points on Vesting::initialize , so some tokens cant be claimed if the sum is not 10_000   

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists in Vesting::initialize  because it doesnt check that the sum of all vesting points percentage is equal to 10_000 ie 100% of tokens. So some tokens percentage became unclaimable.  
Suposse vestingPoints are the following:  
```js
  [
    [1647851220, 100],
    [1647851920, 200],
    [1647852520, 200],
  ]
``` 
The sum of percentages is not 10_000.    
The sum of percentages is not 10_000.  
When calling initialize the vesting points are sorted but the sum of percentages is dropped  
So there is no check for sum to equal 10_000  
```js
function initialize(
    address operator,
    address _tokenSale,
    IERC20 _token,
    address _distributionWallet,
    uint128[2][] memory _vestingPoints
) public initializer {
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, operator);
    tokensale = _tokenSale;
    (vestingPoints, ) = ascendingSort(_vestingPoints); //<@ sum of percentages is dropped
    //... snippet
}

function ascendingSort(
        uint128[2][] memory arr
    ) internal pure returns (uint128[2][] memory, uint256) {
        //... snippet
        uint256 l = arr.length;
        uint256 sum;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < l; i++) {
            //... snippet
            sum += arr[i][1];
        }
        return (arr, sum); // <@ sum returned here  
    }
}
```
So user wont be able to claim part of their tokens because those percentages are used in claim function.  
```js
function claim() external {
    //... snippet
    uint256 pctAmount;
    uint256 i = s.index;
    for (i; i <= vestingPoints.length - 1; i++) {
        if (block.timestamp >= vestingPoints[i][0]) {
            pctAmount += (s.userDeposit * vestingPoints[i][1]) / 10000; //<@ vesting pct
        } //... snippet
    }
    if (pctAmount != 0) {
        //... snippet
        s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
    }
}
```  
Observe that updateVestingPoints correctly performs this checks  
```js
    function updateVestingPoints(
        uint128[2][] memory _vestingPoints
    ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        uint256 sum;
        (vestingPoints, sum) = ascendingSort(_vestingPoints);
        require(sum == 10000, "sum not 10000"); //<@ CHECK HERE
        require(block.timestamp <= _vestingPoints[0][0], "Time lapsed");
    }
```  

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that some tokens could be left unclaimed because there is no sum percentage check on Vesting::initialize

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability  it is recommended to check vesting points percentage sum on Vesting::initialize:  
```js
function initialize(
        address operator,
        address _tokenSale,
        IERC20 _token,
        address _distributionWallet,
        uint128[2][] memory _vestingPoints
    ) public initializer {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, operator);
        tokensale = _tokenSale;
        uint256 sum;
        (vestingPoints,sum ) = ascendingSort(_vestingPoints);
        require(sum == 10000, "sum not 10000");
```
