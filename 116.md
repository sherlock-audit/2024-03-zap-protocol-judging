# [M-1]No Protection of Uninitialized Implementation Contracts From Attacker

## Summary

When using OpenZeppelin's Initializable, it is crucial to implement _disableInitializers in the constructor. Failure to do so can potentially leave the contract vulnerable to takeover by an attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail

OpenZeppelin's documentation highlights the importance of avoiding leaving a contract uninitialized:

[OpenZeppelin Documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy#Initializable:~:text=Avoid%20leaving%20a,constructor%0Aconstructor()%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20_disableInitializers()%3B%0A%7D)

```text
Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.

An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

However, three contracts in our review do not adhere to this guideline from OpenZeppelin:

TokenSale.sol
Admin.sol
Vesting.sol

## Impact

An uninitialized contract is vulnerable to takeover by an attacker, posing a significant security risk.

## Code Snippet

The following contracts are affected:

- [zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Admin.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Admin.sol#L46)
- [zap-contracts-labs/contracts/TokenSale.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/TokenSale.sol#L71)
- [zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L33)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement the following in the constructor of the affected contracts:

```javascript
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
