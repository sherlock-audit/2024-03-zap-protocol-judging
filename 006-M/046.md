# `destroy()` function cannot be used

## Summary
`selfdestruct` is depreciated since the Ethereum Dencun hardfork. Blast is also using this version of Ethereum.

In this latest upgrade, `selfdestruct()` can only be called if it is called in the same transaction as when the contract is created. This is to allow `selfdestruct()` to continually be allowed to be used as a ETH burning mechanism. But it is not used in this way in our case.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since `destroy()` is clearly not used at contract creation, this function cannot be used.

```javascript
function destroy() external override {
	_onlyAdmin();
	uint256 amountUSDC = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
	if (amountUSDC > 0) {
		usdc.safeTransfer(admin.wallet(), amountUSDC);
	}
	address payable wallet = payable(admin.wallet());
	selfdestruct(wallet);
}
```

## Impact
Admin is unable to `destroy()` the contract.
