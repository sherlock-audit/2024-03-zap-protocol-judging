# Some state variables are not set during initialize

## Summary
The Audius contracts can be upgraded using the [unstructured storage proxy pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades/2.8/proxies). This pattern requires the use of an initializer instead of the constructor to set the initial values of the state variables. In some of the contracts, the initializer is not initializing all of the state variables.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the initialize function, some public state variables are not initialized.

## Impact
Consider setting all the required variables in the initializer. If there is a reason for leaving them uninitialized consider documenting it, and adding checks on the functions that use those variables to ensure that they are not called before initialization.
