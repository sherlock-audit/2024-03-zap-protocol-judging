# Incorrect calculation of user tax rate due to wrong input.

## Summary
The user tax rate is determined by the `userTaxRate()` function. However due to incorrect parameter used as input for the function call the user tax rate will be calculated incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a comment above `userTaxRate()` which states that `_amount` should be in dollar without decimals.

```solidity
// _amount should be in dollar without decimals <-------------@audit
    function userTaxRate( 
        uint256 _amount, 
        address _sender 
    ) public returns (uint256)
```
However the function is called in `_processPrivate()` with `sum` as input for `_amount`. The problem is that `sum` is in dollar WITH decimals while `userTaxRate()` expects to receive an input  in dollar WITHOUT decimals:

```solidity
  uint256 amount = _amount * PCT_BASE; //@audit-multiplies by PCT_BASE (1e18) thus amount is in $ with decimals
  uint256 sum = s.amount + amount; //@audit-adds amount to the sum so sum is also in $ with decimals
 
  uint256 userTxRate = userTaxRate(sum, _sender); //@audit-uses sum($ in decimals) as input to call this function which contradicts with the comment above userTxRate()
```


## Impact
The user tax rate after deposit will be incorrect

Don't multiply by `PCT_BASE`
