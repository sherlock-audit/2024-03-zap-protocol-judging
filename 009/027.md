# Use safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transferFrom

## Summary
The `Admin` contract's `createPoolNew` function utilizes the `transferFrom` function instead of `safeTransferFrom`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `createPoolNew` function, the `transferFrom` function is used to transfer tokens from the sender's address to the newly created instance of a token sale. However, the use of `transferFrom` can pose a risk if the receiving contract does not properly handle the received tokens. The lack of a check on the return value of `transferFrom` makes it vulnerable to potential reentrancy attacks or other unexpected behaviors.

Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false. `transferfrom` is directly used to send tokens in a few places in the `Admin` contract and the return value is not checked. If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.

## Impact
The vulnerability introduced by using `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` could lead to various security issues.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-launches-contracts/contracts/Admin.sol#L310

```solidity
function createPoolNew(
    ITokenSale.Params memory _params,
    ITokenSale.Config memory _config,
    uint256 _maxAllocation,
    bool _isKYC,
    bool isETHBased
) external payable {
    require(msg.value == platformFee,"Invalid platform Fee");
    _checkingParams(_params, _config);
    
    address instance = isETHBased ? Clones.clone(masterTokenSaleETH) : Clones.clone(masterTokenSaleUSDB);
    params[instance] = _params;
    ITokenSale(instance).initialize(
        _params,
        address(this),
        msg.sender,
        _maxAllocation,
        platformTax,
        _isKYC
    );
    ITokenSale(instance).setConfig(_config, msg.sender);
    if(!creators[msg.sender]) creators[msg.sender] = true;
    IERC20D(_params.tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, instance, (_params.totalSupply + _params.tokenLiquidity));
    (bool suc, ) = payable(wallet).call{value: msg.value}("");             
        require(suc, "platformFee trn failed");
    _addToSales(instance);
    emit CreateTokenSale(instance);
}

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the usage of `transferFrom` with `safeTransferFrom` to mitigate potential vulnerabilities associated with the transfer of tokens.
