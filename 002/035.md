## Vulnerability Detail
[Admin.sol#L140](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/c2ad35aa844899fa24f6ed0cbfcf6c7e611b061a/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Admin.sol#L140)
The **destroyInstance** function is intended to be use to cancel an incoming Token Sale, this functionality when open to be executed by any user can lead to DoS as any user can cancel any incoming Token Sale instances.  

## Impact
Malicious user can destroy all incoming instances making it imposible for any instance to complete their intended functionality
