# TokenSale instances can be destroyed by anyone before starting

## Summary
Anyone can call destroyInstance function on the admin contract (zap-contracts-labs). This can cause any TokenSale created that has not started to be destroyed.

## Vulnerability Detail
destroyInstance function doesn't have any protection over who is calling it. It only checks that the instance exists and it's on "Incomming" state.

## Impact
This can lead to any TokenSale created that has not started to be destroyed (selfdestruct) and never used. This can be repeatedly done on every TokenSale bringing the system to a halt (DOS).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add protection to the "destroyInstance" function to only be called by admin or creator of the token sale.
