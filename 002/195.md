# Missing access control in Admin::destroyInstance

## Summary
There is no access control in Admin::destroyInstance

## Vulnerability Detail

When anyone trigger `Admin::destroyInstance`, it can remove any existing instance becoz lack of access control. 
destroyInstance() uses TokenSale::destroy, in TokenSale::destroy it check `_onlyAdmin` to authorize
```solidity
 function _onlyAdmin() internal view {
        require(admin.hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender) || msg.sender == address(admin), "TokenSale: Onlyadmin");
    }
```
in `_onlyAdmin` function it check ` msg.sender == address(admin)` to authorize but `admin` is contract address of the admin contract which is pass in `initialize` function. Not completely check authorize who is calling it.

## Impact
Any user can trigger destroyInstance with _instance value to remove it from sales.
