# Anyone can destroy a token sale instance due to faulty access check

## Summary
There is a faulty restriction check on ```Admin::destroyInstance(address)``` on whoever can call it.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call the ```destroyInstance(address)``` function which will then call the ```TokenSale::destroy()``` function on the ```TokenSale``` contract. Check that ensures restriction is contained in the ```onlyAdmin()``` function call. This check will pass everytime because - 

```solidity
    function _onlyAdmin() internal view {
        require(
            admin.hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender) ||
                msg.sender == address(admin),
            "TokenSale: Onlyadmin"
        );
    }
```
the ```msg.sender``` variable will be the admin contract.

## Impact
Any user can destroy instances.

## Recommendation
Re-design access control on ```TokenSale``` contract or implement one on ```Admin::destroyInstance(address)``` function.
