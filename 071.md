# Missing check for token sale existence can create irremovable duplicates

## Summary
When creating a new pool `_addToSales()` is called to mark the pool as existing with the `tokenSalesM[]` mapping, get the index of the pool and add it to the `tokenSales[]` array. However the function doesn't check if a pool already exists and can create a duplicate in the array which cannot be removed.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we call `_addToSales()` with the address of a pool that has already been added to the `tokenSales[]` array it will push it again and change its index with `indexOfTokenSales[]` mapping.
```Solidity
function _addToSales(address _addr) internal {
        tokenSalesM[_addr] = true;
        indexOfTokenSales[_addr] = tokenSales.length;
        tokenSales.push(_addr);
    }
```
The problem is that it will not remove the old instance of the pool in the array. It also cannot be removed later using `_removeFromSales()` because the `indexOfTokenSales[]` used to access the pool in the array is now changed to index of the new instance.
## Impact
Array can be filled with duplicates.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following check in the `_addToSales`
```solidity
require(!tokenSalesM[_addr], "Pool already added to sales");
```
