# TokenSale::calculateMaxAllocation Incorrect return statements

## Summary
The return statements in the function are swapped. A user can either exceed the maximum allocations or get maximum while having 0

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        if (userMaxAllc > maxAllocation) {
            return userMaxAllc;
        } else {
            return maxAllocation;
        }

```
In the above code snippet if a user is exceeding the `maxAllocation` he will get still get that amount that exceeds it instead of it being lowered to the maximum. In the case that it doesn't then the user automatically gets the maximum.
## Impact
A user can exploit this by either intentionally going above the max or simply having zero allocation in order to get the max.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Swap the return statements

```diff
        if (userMaxAllc > maxAllocation) {
+            return maxAllocation;
-            return userMaxAllc;
        } else {
+            return userMaxAllc;
-            return maxAllocation;
        }

```
