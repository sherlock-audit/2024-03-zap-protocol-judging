# [Vesting.sol] An attacker can steal all the native tokens in the contract

## Summary
In `Vesting::claim()`, a reentrancy exists which allows anyone with allocated funds to drain the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
- The `claim` function allows users to claim the tokens which are allocated to them
- If the `token == address(1)` (i.e. the native token) it performs an external call which sends the token to msg.sender and then updates the storage variable.
```solidity
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
            } else {
                token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
            }
            s.index = uint128(i);
            s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
        }
```
- This allows an attacker to reenter the `claim` function until the contract is drained completely.

## Impact
The contract can be drained completely.

```solidity
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
            } else {
                token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
            }
            s.index = uint128(i);
            s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Follow CEI pattern
- Use `nonReentrant` modifier
