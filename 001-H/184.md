# Reentrancy allows attacker to drain contract through repeated calls through `claim` in `Vesting.sol`

## Summary

Reentrancy allows attacker to drain contract through repeated calls to `claim` in `Vesting.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Vesting.sol`, we find the following code snippet in `claim`:

```solidity
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                // @audit: reentrancy allows you to drain the contract here
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
            } else {
                token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
            }
            s.index = uint128(i);
            s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
        }
``` 

Clearly, the ETH is first sent to the user and then the index is updated. The line specifically that introduces the reentrancy is:

`(bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");`

This hands back control to the sender. The sender can then repeatedly re-enter `claim`, and because `s.index` has not been updated yet, they can get the same amount of vested funds out every single time. This allows the attacker to drain the contract. 

## Impact

Drain the contract of ETH through reentrancy
