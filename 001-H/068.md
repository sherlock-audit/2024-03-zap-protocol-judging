# Reentrancy in `claim` Function Leads to Unauthorized Token Withdrawal

## Summary

Reentrancy vulnerability in `claim` function of `vesting.sol` due to state updates after external calls.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `claim` function in `vesting.sol` allows users to claim their vested tokens. However, when the payout is in the native currency (e.g., ETH, BNB), the function performs an external call to send the currency before updating the user's claim state. This ordering allows for a potential reentrancy attack, where an attacker could repeatedly call the `claim` function to drain the contract's funds before the state is updated to reflect their claim.

## Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to claim more than they are entitled to, potentially draining the contract's funds allocated for vesting. This would not only result in financial loss but could also undermine the integrity of the vesting process, affecting all stakeholders.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to use the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern. The state update (s.index = uint128(i); s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;) should be performed before any external calls to send funds. This prevents reentrancy by ensuring that the state reflects the claim before any external interaction occurs.
