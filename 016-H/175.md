# Inconsistency with tax calculation and refunds

## Summary

There are several inconsistencies with tax calculations and refunds that leads to users getting an incorrect amount of funds back. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user is first charged tax, the amount of tax that will be levied is automatically: `userTaxAmount = (amount * userTxRate) / POINT_BASE;` because `taxFreeAllcOfUser` is hardcoded to `0` in `_processPrivate` in `TokenSale.sol`. However, inside the `claim` function in `TokenSale.sol`, the `taxFreeAllc` is computed differently and consequently the refund amount looks different:

```solidity
            uint256 taxFreeAllc = _maxTaxfreeAllocation(msg.sender) * PCT_BASE;
            if (taxFreeAllc >= s.share) {
                refundTaxAmount = s.taxAmount;
            } else {
                refundTaxAmount = (left * tax) / POINT_BASE;
            }
```

This computation is just incorrect because, even if you assume the intent is to tax the user the full amount and then refund some amount of tax, in the case that `taxFreeAllc < s.share`, the user is not refunded the full amount of tax they should be refunded. They should be refunded `((left + taxFreeAllc) * tax / POINT_BASE)` amount of tax instead (otherwise users will purposely get themselves into a state where `s.share` is just under `taxFreeAllc`).

Another thing that is incorrect about this is earlier in the `claim` function,  we have a `require(left > 0, "TokenSale: Nothing to claim");`. However, clearly, `left > 0` is not required to receive a tax refund based on the current design, so users who have `left = 0` are just missing out on this refund for no reason. 

## Impact

Users receive incorrect amount of tax refund back
