# Lack of External Interface for IDO Removal in Admin.sol.

## Summary
Admin.sol in the folder zap-launches-contracts includes an internal function, _removeFromSales, which is designed to remove an IDO instance from the contract's list of managed IDO sales. However, there is no parent or external function provided within the contract that allows for the invocation of _removeFromSales, limiting the contract administrators' ability to manage IDO instances efficiently. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract Admin.sol possesses an internal function _removeFromSales, intended for the removal of IDO (Initial DEX Offering) instances from the contract's management list, tokenSales. This function is crucial for maintaining the contract's health by allowing for the removal of completed, cancelled, or otherwise unnecessary IDO instances to prevent clutter and ensure efficient management.

However, upon closer examination of the contract, it's evident that there is no public or external function provided that facilitates the invocation of _removeFromSales. This omission presents a significant oversight in the contract's design, as it effectively prevents contract admin from performing necessary cleanup operations on the list of managed IDOs.

The inability to remove IDO instances externally means that once an IDO is added to the tokenSales list, there is no provided mechanism within the contract to remove or manage it, regardless of its state or relevance. This design flaw can lead to outdated or irrelevant IDO instances persisting in the contract's management indefinitely, potentially causing confusion and mismanagement.

The lack of a direct interface for removing IDO instances could also lead to complications in scenarios where an IDO needs to be urgently removed due to discovered vulnerabilities, changes in regulatory status, or other critical reasons. Without the ability to efficiently manage the lifecycle of each IDO instance, the contract may not be able to respond adequately to emerging challenges or requirements.

## Impact

The absence of a mechanism to remove IDO instances could result in several adverse effects, including:
Inefficient Contract Management: Administrators might find it challenging to keep the contract's state clean and up-to-date, leading to potential clutter and inefficiency.
Increased Gas Costs: Over time, as more IDO instances are added without the ability to remove them, the cost of operations involving iterating over the tokenSales array could increase.
Security Risks: In scenarios requiring the removal of an IDO instance due to discovered vulnerabilities or other issues, the inability to do so promptly could pose security risks may lead to loss of user funds.
