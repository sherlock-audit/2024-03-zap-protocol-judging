# Users who create token using `ERC20Factory.sol` cannot mint additional tokens

## Summary
Every user who create token using the `ERC20Factory.sol` cannot mint any additional token beyond the initialSupply.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ERC20Factory has a single function that allows anyone to create token using it.

```javascript
function createToken(string memory name, string memory symbol, uint256 initialSupply, uint8 decimals) public {
    new SimpleERC20(
        name,
        symbol,
        decimals,
        initialSupply, 
        msg.sender
    );  
}   
```

It creates this new ERC20 token using the SimpleERC20 contract with `initialSupply`. However, SimpleERC20 inherits OpenZeppelin's ERC20 contract.

This implementation only has the internal `_mint()` function. Anyone who has created this contract, is stuck with only the initial supply. Even the `owner` cannot change it.

## Impact
Unable to mint new tokens beyond initial supply.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the necessary wrapper around ERC20 contract, such as `mint()` and `burn()`.
