# `claim` in `Vesting.sol` is vulnerable to reentrancy

## Summary
The claim method in the provided smart contract is vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack, allowing malicious actors to potentially claim more funds than they are entitled to under specific conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the contract's failure to update a user's claim state (s.index and s.amountClaimed) before transferring funds to the user via 
```solidity 
(bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}(""); 
```
 This oversight allows a malicious contract to receive the funds and re-enter the claim function before the original call completes, potentially claiming more funds repeatedly.

```solidity
function claim() external {
      address sender = msg.sender;
      UserDetails storage s = userdetails[sender];
      require(s.userDeposit != 0, "No Deposit");
      require(s.index != vestingPoints.length, "already claimed");
      uint256 pctAmount;
      uint256 i = s.index;
      for (i; i <= vestingPoints.length - 1; i++) {
          if (block.timestamp >= vestingPoints[i][0]) {
              pctAmount += (s.userDeposit * vestingPoints[i][1]) / 10000;
          } else {
              break;
          }
      }
      if (pctAmount != 0) {
          if (address(token) == address(1)) {
              (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}(""); // @audit reentrancy
              require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
          } else {
              token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
          }
          s.index = uint128(i);
          s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
      }
  }
```
## Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to significant financial loss for the contract and its users. Specifically, attackers could drain the contract's funds allocated for user claims by repeatedly invoking the vulnerable `claim` method within a single transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider employing the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern, ensuring state changes are finalized before calling external contracts or sending ETH. Specifically:

1. Update State Before Transfers: Move the s.index and s.amountClaimed state updates before the external call or token transfer.
```solidity
if (pctAmount != 0) {
    s.index = uint128(i);
    s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
    
    if (address(token) == address(1)) {
        (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}(""); 
        require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
    } else {
        token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
    }
}
```

2. Reentrancy Guard: Implement a reentrancy guard mechanism. This can be as simple as a boolean flag that checks if the function is already being executed. OpenZeppelin provides a `ReentrancyGuard` contract that can be easily integrated into existing contracts to prevent re-entrancy.
