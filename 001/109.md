# Vesting.sol allows unlimited claims due to reentrancy

## Summary
The claim of rewards on the Vesting.sol contract allows a single attacker to claim all the rewards due to reentrancy.

## Vulnerability Detail
The state update on the Vesting.sol claim function is done after the funds are transferred. When these funds are ether, it allows for an attacker contract to call the function again. Example
Attacker A  holds a contract B. Contract B is provided to the protocol to get vesting balance on [updateUserDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L53). 
When the attacker claims his reward with the [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L67) function and the reward is ether the following call stack is possible:

attacker_contract - > vesting.claim -> sends ether -> attacker_contract.receive -> vesting.claim -> repeat..

The only check made in the claim function to avoid a user claiming multiple times is the user claim [index](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L74-L75), the problem arises because this index is updated [after](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L89) the funds are transferred, so when the attacker contract receives ether, the index is still the original one.

## Impact
Loss of user rewards on Vesting.sol contract (ether only)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add reentrancy guard or update the user claim index before the funds are transfered
