# function claim reentrancy leads to stolen funds

## Summary
There exists a reentrancy vulnerability in claim function of Vesting.sol which leads to draining of contract funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
claim function loops over `vestingPoints` and calculates `pctAmount` to send this amount of token to users. Only after sending this amount the contract updates state, violating CEI pattern. If the token used here is ETH, an adversary can keep reentering claim function to drain funds of the contract.
## Impact
Draining contract funds.
