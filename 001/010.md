# Users can drain the vesting contract with reentrancy

## Summary
The claim function in `Vesting.sol` does not do the checks-effects-interactions patter allowing a user to reenter it and claim more than they are allowed to.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario: A malicious user's contract has a receive function that check the balance of the vesting contract and reenters the claim function before the s.index and s.amountClaimed are set. By doing the user will be able to drain the whole contract.
## Impact
Malicious users will be able to drain to drain the whole Vesting contract - High.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the claim function and move the effects before the interaction as follows:
```solidity
function claim() external {
        address sender = msg.sender;

        UserDetails storage s = userdetails[sender];
        require(s.userDeposit != 0, "No Deposit");
        require(s.index != vestingPoints.length, "already claimed");
        uint256 pctAmount;
        uint256 i = s.index;
        for (i; i <= vestingPoints.length - 1; i++) {
            if (block.timestamp >= vestingPoints[i][0]) {
                pctAmount += (s.userDeposit * vestingPoints[i][1]) / 10000;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            s.index = uint128(i);
            s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent,) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}(""); //@audit reentrancy?
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
            } else {
                token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
            }
        }
    }
```
