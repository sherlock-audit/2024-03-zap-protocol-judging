# Vesting.sol::claim User can steal all the native tokens

## Summary
In Vesting::claim()  re-entrancy is possible which allows anyone to steal native tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the claim function an external call is made before updating state variables.

```solidity
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
            } else {
                token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
            }
            s.index = uint128(i);
            s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
        }
```
The attacker will be allowed to re-enter the claim function and drain the contract.

## Impact
The contract will be drained of its native tokens
