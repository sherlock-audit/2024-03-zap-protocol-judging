# Attacker can drain ETH from vesting contract

## Summary
Claiming token is susceptible to reentrancy attack

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside Vesting.sol, function [claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L67-L92) is vulnerable to reentrancy attack.
Below is the brief explanation to show how attack can take place.
1. Firstly attacker calls claim().
2. while sending ETH to the attacker `(bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");` will trigger fallback() of attacker contract ( handling control to the external contract ).
3. Inside fallback, It can again call claim().
4. As `s.index` not updated yet so when calling claim again by attacker this check ` require(s.index != vestingPoints.length, "already claimed");` will pass .
5. attacker can keep claiming ETH untill contract drains.

## Impact
Loss of funds from vesting contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply check effects interactions pattern, Here before sending ETH update states 
`s.index = uint128(i)`
 `s.amountClaimed += pctAmount`
 also can apply ReentrancyGuard to avoid reentrancy attack.
