# UpdateVestingPoints should not be allowed because slightiest of error can cause some users to not claim their tokens

## Summary
UpdateVestingPoints should not be allowed because slightiest of error can cause some users to not claim their tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is updateVestingPoints function
```solidity
function updateVestingPoints(
        uint128[2][] memory _vestingPoints
    ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        uint256 sum;
        (vestingPoints, sum) = ascendingSort(_vestingPoints);
        require(sum == 10000, "sum not 10000");
        require(block.timestamp <= _vestingPoints[0][0], "Time lapsed");
    }
```
From above when ascendingSort is called it only sorts the _vestingPoints[i][0] elements not the _vestingPoints[i][1]
So if someone has claimed their token till vestingPoints.length - 2 index and has claimed 50% of the tokens and has only 50% tokens left to claim .Now if updateVesting points is called and makes the vestingPoints[vestingPoints.length - 1][1] = 6000(60%) then the user will be able to claim more tokens than 100% conversly if updateVestingPoints makes vestingPoints[vestingPoints.length - 1][1] = 40% then user will receive less tokens.
## Impact
User may receive less or more tokens.It can also drain the contract and some users may not be able to claim their tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should not updateVesting if a user has started a claim before or maybe introduce a check for values of _vestingPoints[i][1] to be same as previous points.
