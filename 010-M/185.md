# maxAllocation is given double decimal precision of 10 ** 18, leading to accounting issues

## Summary
maxAllocation is given double decimal precision of 10 ** 18, leading to accounting issues

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the specs, the maxAllocation will be set in dollar **with decimals**

>     uint256 public maxAllocation; // in dollar with decimals

However, this maxAllocation still gets multiplied with decimal precision of 10 ** 18 in the `_processPrivate()` and `claim()` functions
_processPrivate():
```solidity
 uint256 maxAllocationOfUser = (calculateMaxAllocation(_sender)) *
            PCT_BASE;
```
claim():
```solidity
            uint256 taxFreeAllc = _maxTaxfreeAllocation(msg.sender) * PCT_BASE;
```
Leading to multiple accounting issues.

## Impact
maxAllocation getting double decimal precision of 10 ** 18 will lead to multiple accounting issues

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the maxAllocation will already be with decimals, it should not be multiplied with PCT_BASE.
