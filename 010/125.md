# Admin::addToBlackList doesnt provide a method to unblacklist user

## Summary
Admin::addToBlackList function does not implement a method to unblacklist users  

This means that if an admin calls addToBlackList and blacklists an user by mistake the user is blacklisted forever and there is no way to undo the ban.    

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists in Admin contract  because it doesnt provide a way to remove a user from blacklist once is added:  
```js
    function addToBlackList(
        address _instance,
        address[] memory _blacklist
    ) external override onlyIncoming(_instance) onlyExist(_instance) onlyRole(OPERATOR) {
        require(_blacklist.length <= 500, "TokenSale: Too large array");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _blacklist.length; i++) {
            blacklist[_instance][_blacklist[i]] = true;
        }
    }
```
   
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that if a user is blacklisted by mistake then is blacklisted forever from a tokenSale because there is no way to undo a blacklist action

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability  it is recommended to add a new method to be able to remove from blacklist:  
```js
    function removeFromBlackList(
        address _instance,
        address[] memory _blacklist
    )
        external
        override
        onlyIncoming(_instance)
        onlyExist(_instance)
        onlyRole(OPERATOR)
    {
        require(_blacklist.length <= 500, "TokenSale: Too large array");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _blacklist.length; i++) {
            blacklist[_instance][_blacklist[i]] = false;
        }
    }
```
