# Only 18 decimal tokens are supported

## Summary

Token sale can only operate with 18 decimal tokens. Other tokens will process incorrect amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

When depositing to the token sale, user provided `_amount` is scaled by `PCT_BASE` which is a constant of `10 ** 18`:
```solidity
    function _processPrivate(address _sender, uint256 _amount) internal {
        require(_amount > 0, "TokenSale: Too small");

        Staked storage s = stakes[_sender];
        uint256 amount = _amount * PCT_BASE; // 10 ** 18
        uint256 sum = s.amount + amount;

        ...
        uint256 taxFreeAllcOfUser = 0; // hardcode zero - all pools have ax

        uint256 userTaxAmount;

        if (sum > taxFreeAllcOfUser) {
            uint256 userTxRate = userTaxRate(sum, _sender);
            if (s.amount < taxFreeAllcOfUser) {
                userTaxAmount =
                    ((sum - taxFreeAllcOfUser) * userTxRate) /
                    POINT_BASE;
            } else {
                userTaxAmount = (amount * userTxRate) / POINT_BASE;
            }
        }

        if (userTaxAmount > 0) {
            s.taxAmount += userTaxAmount;
            usdc.safeTransferFrom(_sender, marketingWallet, userTaxAmount);
        }
        s.amount += uint128(amount);
        state.totalPrivateSold += uint128(amount);
        usdc.safeTransferFrom(_sender, address(this), amount);

        ...
    }
```

For example, the user tax amount is calculated as:
`userTaxAmount = (amount * userTxRate) / POINT_BASE;`
this translates to:
`userTaxAmount = (_amount * 10 ** 18 * userTxRate) / 1000;`
where `userTxRate` is denominated in `1000`.
Then this amount is transferred to the wallet:
`usdc.safeTransferFrom(_sender, marketingWallet, userTaxAmount);`

It means the user has to provide a pure base value without decimals. Then the protocol scales it by `10 ** 18`. This scale factor only works as intended with 18 decimal tokens. If the token has less decimals, it will overinflate the value. According to the contest description, it should work with most ERC20 tokens:
**Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
any standard ERC20 & our own custom ERC20**

## Impact

The token sale will misbehave with tokens with decimals != 18.

## Recommendation

Refactor the code to fetch token decimals and validate or explicitly state that only 18 decimals are supported.
