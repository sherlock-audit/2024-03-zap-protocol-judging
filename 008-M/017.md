# Duplicate input variables may lead to wrong and repetitive token extraction from distribution wallet in Vesting.sol

## Summary
If duplicate inputs are passed for the function `updateUserDeposit()`, it may lead to a wrong token extraction
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `updateUserDeposit()` is responsible for depositing the corresponding tokens of the users to the contract Vesting.sol.
This function can be called by an authorized admin and the only restrictions are the identical lengths of the users and amounts. 
```Solidity
    function updateUserDeposit(
        address[] memory _users,
        uint256[] memory _amount
    ) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        require(_users.length <= 250, "array length should be less than 250");
        require(_users.length == _amount.length, "array length should match");
        uint256 amount;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
            userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
            amount += _amount[i];
        }
        token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);
    }
```

As it is seen from the code, if the admin mistakenly passes duplicate users, then the final amount is calculated wrongly. The variable `userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit` is not updated and for each duplicate field, the `amount` would be summed up by the repetitive variables and the final amount would be wrong.
## Impact
Wrong token extraction from the wallet may lead to insolvency and wrong token distribution
## Code Snippet
The function [updateUserDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L53-L65):
```Solidity
function updateUserDeposit(
        address[] memory _users,
        uint256[] memory _amount
    ) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        require(_users.length <= 250, "array length should be less than 250");
        require(_users.length == _amount.length, "array length should match");
        uint256 amount;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
            userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
            amount += _amount[i];
        }
        token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);
    }
```

For the POC section we can have this scenario:

1. Admin wants to update Allice's deposit amount among the other 200 users.
2. Allice's deposit is 10 times bigger than the average deposit amount.
3. Admin mistakenly enters Allice's data twice.
4. The distribution wallet would be costed more than usual.

```Solidity
    function test_duplicateInputs() public {
    
        deal(address(token), distributionWallet, 10 ether);
        
        address[] memory _addresses = new address[](2);
        uint256[] memory _amounts = new uint256[](2);
        
        _addresses[0] = allice;
        _addresses[1] = allice;
        
        _amounts[0] = 5 ether; // The balance assumption of Allice
        _amounts[1] = 5 ether;
        
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        updateUserDeposit(_addresses, _amounts);
        
        uint ballanceOfWallet = token.balanceOf(distributionWallet);
        console.log("Wallet token balance is: ", ballanceOfWallet); // It becomes 0 as it double spends Allice's tokens
    
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider catching and preventing duplicate fields by assigning a boolean variable for every address that prevents duplicate variables. This pattern will be useful in the case where there are large input users.
