# `updateUserDeposit` may overwrite user's existing deposit.

## Summary
When updating user's deposit, if the user already has a deposit in `userdetails`, his existing deposit will be overridden. This will cause the user to lose his existing deposit, and subsequently receives fewer tokens upon claiming.

## Vulnerability Detail
When updating user's deposit, `updateUserDeposit` does not check if the user already has a deposit in `userdetails`. It is possible that user may have existing deposits, as he can deposit multiple times through `TokenSale.deposit`. If the user does have a deposit, then his existing deposit will be overridden by the new deposit. In fact, the new deposit should be added to his existing deposits. This leads to user lose his existing deposits, and subsequently receives fewer tokens upon claiming, as the amount claimed is proportional to the user's total deposits.

54:        address[] memory _users,

57:        require(_users.length <= 250, "array length should be less than 250");
58:        require(_users.length == _amount.length, "array length should match");

Manual Review

## Recommendation
New deposits should be added to the user's existing deposit, not overwrite it.
```solidity
    function updateUserDeposit(...) {
...        
-       userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
+       userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit += _amount[i];
...
    }
```
