# `calculateMaxAllocation` computes max allocation incorrectly

## Summary


`calculateMaxAllocation` takes the maximum of `userMaxAllc` and `maxAllocation` in order to compute the max allocation. However, it should be taking the minimum. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the relevant code:

```solidity
    function calculateMaxAllocation(address _sender) public returns (uint256) {
        uint256 userMaxAllc = _maxTierAllc(_sender);

        if (userMaxAllc > maxAllocation) {
            return userMaxAllc;
        } else {
            return maxAllocation;
        }
    }
```

The way that this is currently written, even if the user has very little or even no allocation, they will get up to `maxAllocation`. This is clearly not intended protocol design and ends up allowing users to take way more allocation than intended, defeating the purpose of a private token sale. Users can also sybil with this to take extreme amounts more allocation than intended. 

## Impact

Users can take way more allocation than intended
