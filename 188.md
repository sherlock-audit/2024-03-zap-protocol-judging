# Locked Ether in TokenSale.sol contract

## Summary

The TokenSale.sol contract can receive ETH but it will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Locked Ether vulnerability refers to smart contract code that may cause ether to become irretrievable or inaccessible from a smart contract's address. This ether can neither be accessed by the contract's creator nor any users who might have sent their funds to the contract. It essentially remains frozen within the blockchain.

## Impact

Users can lost funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The developer should add a withdraw() function to avoid Ether locked.
