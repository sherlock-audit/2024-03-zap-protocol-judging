# Missing `payable fallback` or `receive` method to Vesting Contract

## Summary
The current implementation of the Vesting contract allows for the management of both ERC20 tokens and native Ethereum tokens (e.g., ETH). However, it lacks a `receive` method or a `payable fallback` function, which is essential for handling direct Ether transfers. Without these, the contract cannot accept Ether, hindering its intended functionality to work with native coins.

## Vulnerability Detail
In a EVM, contracts can receive native coin in two ways: through a function marked `payable` or via a `receive` method (`receive() external payable`) which is called when the contract receives Ether without a function call. The absence of both a `payable fallback` function and a `receive` method in the Vesting contract means it will reject any Ether sent to it directly, which contradicts its design to support native token operations alongside ERC20 tokens.

## Impact
This limitation restricts the contract's usability, preventing it from receiving and managing native tokens (ETH) as part of its vesting mechanism. This could limit the contract's applicability in scenarios where both ERC20 tokens and native Ether are expected to be managed, potentially impacting its adoption and functionality.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, it is recommended to add a receive method to the contract. This will allow the contract to accept Ether transactions directly, aligning with its design to manage both ERC20 and native tokens. If additional logic is required for handling incoming Ether (e.g., for logging, reverting under certain conditions, or crediting the sender), it should be implemented within the receive method cautiously.
