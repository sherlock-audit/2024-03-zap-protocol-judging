# There is no receive or payable function in Vesting.sol

## Summary
In `Vesting.sol`, a user cannot receive the native currency of the Blast chain because it cannot be sent to a `Vesting` smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the `initialize` function in the `Vesting` smart contract, the token that users will receive is specified. If the token address is set to `address(1)`, it means that users will receive the native currency.
```solidity
 if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
```

But the transaction with the `claim` function call will simply fail because there is no native currency on the `Vesting` smart contract.

## Impact

The `claim` function will always fail, and the user will not receive the native currency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider sending native currency to the `Vesting` smart contract through the `updateUserDeposit` function if the token address is `address(1)`.
