# [Vesting.sol] Admin Cannot Deposit Native Token

## Summary
The `Vesting` contract allows an admin to vest tokens which the users can claim as time passes. If the token is the native token, then it cannot be deposited in the `Vesting.sol` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
- In `Vesting.sol`, an admin can vest native tokens and ERC20 tokens. It can be concluded by observing the `claim()` function:
```solidity
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
            } else {
                token.safeTransfer(sender, pctAmount);
            }
```
- If `token == address(1)`, it's a native token, else it's an ERC20.
- The issue is that the admin cannot deposit the native token as `updateUserDeposit()` is not payable, additionally, it tries to transfer in the tokens using `safeTransferFrom`. It will revert.
```solidity
    function updateUserDeposit(
        address[] memory _users,
        uint256[] memory _amount
    ) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        require(_users.length <= 250, "array length should be less than 250");
        require(_users.length == _amount.length, "array length should match");
        uint256 amount;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
            userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
            amount += _amount[i];
        }
        token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);
    }
```
## Impact
- Native token cannot be vested in `Vesting.sol`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Modify the `updateUserDeposit()` to accept native token by setting it as payable and adding a condition to use `safeTransferFrom` only in case `token != address(1)`.
