# `updateUserDeposit` function in `Vesting.sol` doesnt work for ETH

## Summary

The `updateUserDeposit` function in `Vesting.sol` doesn't seem to work for ETH, even though ETH should be supported. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `updateUserDeposit` function, we find the following piece of code:

`token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);`

However, when `token = address(1)` (i.e. ETH / native token is specified), we should be using `msg.value` instead of ERC20 `safeTransferFrom`. So, this will revert for ETH / native token. Currently, this function is the only way of specifying the amount of user deposits, so the entire contract simply will not work for the native token case. 

## Impact

Entire `Vesting.sol` contract will be broken for ETH case as user deposits cannot be specified.

## Recommendation
Allow passing ETH through `msg.value` instead of `token.safeTransferFrom`
