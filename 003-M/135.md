# Native token vesting is not supported

## Summary

It is not possible to deposit native tokens for vesting even though the claim supports it.

## Vulnerability Detail

`updateUserDeposit` function allows an admin to set user allocations of vested tokens:

```solidity
    function updateUserDeposit(
        address[] memory _users,
        uint256[] memory _amount
    ) public onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        require(_users.length <= 250, "array length should be less than 250");
        require(_users.length == _amount.length, "array length should match");
        uint256 amount;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
            userdetails[_users[i]].userDeposit = _amount[i];
            amount += _amount[i];
        }
        token.safeTransferFrom(distributionWallet, address(this), amount);
    }
```
At the end of this function, it transfers the total amount of tokens from `distributionWallet` to the `Vesting` contract. Thus every token must follow the ERC20 standard. However, it does not support native token, while `claim` function has a special case when the token is `0x1`:
```solidity
 if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
            }
```

## Impact

Native tokens cannot be vested.

## Recommendation

Unify the usage, either add support for the native token or remove it altogether.
