# `Vesting.sol` not compatible with nativeETH

## Summary
Title
## Vulnerability Detail
Contract is expected to work with nativeETH according to [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L82-L85). 
```solidity
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
```
However, `Vesting.sol` does not have any payable functions, no receive or fallback and updateUserDeposit works only with tokens.
## Impact
Broken core functionality 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        if (pctAmount != 0) {
            if (address(token) == address(1)) {
                (bool sent, ) = payable(sender).call{value: pctAmount}("");
                require(sent, "Failed to send BNB to receiver");
```
