# Blacklisted users can still call `claim`

## Summary 
`blockClaim` is checked against contract address(this) instead of msg.sender
## Vulnerability Detail
According to its' [natspec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/c2ad35aa844899fa24f6ed0cbfcf6c7e611b061a/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Admin.sol#L268-L281), `blockClaim` mapping takes user addresses to check whether they are blacklisted/whitelisted. However in `TokenSale.claim` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/c2ad35aa844899fa24f6ed0cbfcf6c7e611b061a/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/TokenSale.sol#L364-L370) it is checked against address(this) which is the contract address, resulting in blacklisted users passing this check and still being able to receive funds.
## Impact
Broken core functionality / Unexpected behaviour
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
    function claim() external {
        checkingEpoch();
        require(
            uint8(epoch) > 1 && !admin.blockClaim(address(this)),
            "TokenSale: Not time or not allowed"
        );
        ...
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use msg.sender instead of address(this)
