# `admin.blockClaim` is used incorrectly

## Summary

The purpose of `blockClaim` is to block specific users from being able to claim allocation and receive the refund. However, this is not checked correctly. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the `setClaimBlock` function in `Admin.sol`:

```solidity
    /**
     @dev Whitelist users
     @param _address Address of User
     */
    function setClaimBlock(address _address) external onlyRole(OPERATOR) {
        blockClaim[_address] = true;
    }
```

Clearly the function is meant to blacklist/whitelist users. 

However, in `TokenSale.sol`, `claim` function:

```solidity
        require(
            // @audit: this block claim doesn't work, should be msg.sender
            uint8(epoch) > 1 && !admin.blockClaim(address(this)),
            "TokenSale: Not time or not allowed"
        );
```

We check whether `blockClaim` is enabled for the `TokenSale` instance rather than for specific users, which is clearly not the intent. 

## Impact

`blockClaim` doesn't function as intended

## Recommendation
change `!admin.blockClaim(address(this))` to `!admin.blockClaim(msg.sender)`
