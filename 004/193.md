# The user can receive too much refundTaxAmount than their deposit tax amount

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
User pays a tax amount in `USDC` when making a `TokenSale.deposit`. However, if the deposited amount is less than the user's tax, the user does not pay tax.
```solidity
if (_amount > userTaxFreeAllc) {
            if (isWhitelisted[_sender]) {
                return whitelistTxRate;
            } else {
                return globalTaxRate;
            }
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
```
Consider the following scenario:

1)The user deposits `_amount < userTaxFreeAllc` value of USDC.
2)The user deposits 100 USDC.
3)Later, in the `claim` function, they receive a tax refund for the total amount they deposited (first + second). However, for the first deposit, there is no tax.

## Impact
User can get higher tax refund.
