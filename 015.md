# Unsafe Casting of `s.index` from `uint256` to `uint128`

## Summary
In the `claim` function of the smart contract, there's an unsafe casting operation where the `s.index` variable, declared as `uint128`, is assigned the value of `i`, which is of type `uint256`. This casting operation could potentially lead to unexpected behaviour or loss of data if the value of `i` exceeds the maximum range representable by a `uint128`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `claim` function is responsible for allowing users to claim their vested tokens based on the vesting schedule. After calculating the amount of tokens to be claimed, the function updates the `s.index` variable to mark the vesting point as claimed by the user. However, the casting operation `s.index = uint128(i);` poses a risk if i exceeds the maximum value representable by a `uint128`. In Solidity, when casting from a larger to a smaller integer type, the higher-order bits are truncated, potentially leading to loss of data or unexpected behaviour.

```solidity
function claim() external {
    address sender = msg.sender;
    UserDetails storage s = userdetails[sender];

    // Code for calculating pctAmount skipped for brevity

    if (pctAmount != 0) {
        // Unsafe casting operation
        s.index = uint128(i);
        s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
    }
}
```
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that if the value of `i` exceeds the maximum range representable by a `uint128`, the casting operation will truncate the higher-order bits, potentially leading to incorrect indexing or loss of information about the claimed vesting points for the user. This could result in users not receiving their tokens properly or claiming them prematurely.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's crucial to perform a bounds check on the value of `i` before performing the casting operation. This check ensures that `i` does not exceed the maximum range representable by a `uint128`, thereby preventing potential truncation or loss of data. Here's how the mitigation can be implemented:
```solidity
if (pctAmount != 0) {
    // Mitigation: Perform bounds check before casting
    require(i <= type(uint128).max, "Index exceeds uint128 range");
    s.index = uint128(i);
    s.amountClaimed += pctAmount;
}
```
