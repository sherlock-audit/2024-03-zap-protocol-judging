# Lack of access control for `Admin::destroyInstance()`


## Summary
Lack of access control in `Admin.destroyInstance()` can lead to a denial-of-service attack. Anyone can destroy the Incoming instance of Tokensale. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the context, `Admin.destroyInstance()` should only be allowed to be called by the onlyAdmin.

However, `Admin.destroyInstance()` lack access control in the current implementation.
```javascript
function destroyInstance(
        address _instance
    ) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) {
        _removeFromSales(_instance);
        ITokenSale(_instance).destroy();
    }

```

## Impact
The operator have to deploy the instance of TokenSale again and again.
