# Anyone can destroy TokenSale's incoming instance

## Summary
No access specifier used in function destroyInstance()

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside contract Admin.sol, in function destroyInstance() there is no access specifier which specifies that only particular role can destroy TokenSale instances due to which anyone has the privilege to destroy instance created by operator.

## Impact
An attacker can destroy all the new incoming pool created by operator.
