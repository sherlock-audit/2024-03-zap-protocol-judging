# Due to missing access control, anyone can destroy an existing TokenSale instance by calling `zap-labs/Admin::destroyInstance()`

## Summary

Anyone can call `Admin::destroyInstance()` and destroy an existing instance of TokenSale.

## Vulnerability Detail

A critical function such as `Admin::destroyInstance()` should allow an admin or an operator to destroy an existing TokenSale instance before its launch date. However, the function isn't protected by any access control modifier allowing anyone to call it.

```js
function destroyInstance(address _instance ) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) { 
    _removeFromSales(_instance);
    ITokenSale(_instance).destroy(); 
}
```

The TokenSale contract, inside his destroy function, uses the following `_onlyAdmin()` access control check:

```js
function _onlyAdmin() internal view {
        require(
            admin.hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender) ||
                msg.sender == address(admin),
            "TokenSale: Onlyadmin"
        );
    }
```

During an external call `msg.sender` changes, in this case to the address of the admin contract that is authorized to call `TokenSale::destroy()` so, even if `Admin::destroyInstance` was called by an unauthorized account, the check above will pass anyway.

## Impact

Anyone can sabotage a token launch by repeatedly destroying it every time the event `CreateTokenSale` is emitted, requiring additional gas to refund users whose funds have been sent to the admin wallet.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protect the function with the `onlyAdmin()` modifier.

```js
function destroyInstance(address _instance ) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) onlyAdmin() { 
    _removeFromSales(_instance);
    ITokenSale(_instance).destroy(); 
}
```
