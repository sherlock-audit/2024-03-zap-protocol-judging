# Anyone can destroy TokenSale instance before pool started

## Summary
In the `Admin.sol` contract from `zap-contract-labs`, any user can call the `destroyInstance` function before pool started, which in turn can destroy the `TokenSale` smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check who can call `destroyInstance` function.
```solidity
function destroyInstance(
        address _instance
    ) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) {
        _removeFromSales(_instance);
        ITokenSale(_instance).destroy();
    }
```

## Impact
Anyone can destroy `TokenSale` smart contract before pool started.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a check to the `destroyInstance` function in the `Admin.sol` contract to ensure that only the `Operator` can call it.
