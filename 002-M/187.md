# Everyone can destroy Incoming TokenSale

## Summary
Everyone can destroy Incoming TokenSale

## Vulnerability Detail
Everyone can destroy incoming `TokenSale` because of the lack of access control in the `destroyInstance` function in the `Admin` contract.

When an operator creates a new `TokenSale` contract, they can set the start of the token sale in the near future.

```solidity
        require(
            _params.privateStart >= block.timestamp,
            "TokenSale: Start time > 0"
        );
```
Every `TokenSale` scheduled to start in the near future, let's say the operator wants to start after 2 days after creating, can be destroyed by anyone just by calling the `destroyInstance` function.

## Impact
It will be impossible to schedule the `TokenSale` in the near future.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Admin.sol#L138

```solidity
    function destroyInstance( 
        address _instance
    ) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) {
        
        _removeFromSales(_instance);
        ITokenSale(_instance).destroy();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control. Only the Operator should be able to destroy incoming `TokenSale`.
