# Anyone can destroy an IDO that hasn't started yet

## Summary
Zap Labs helps projects launch an IDO. The launch is permissioned and controlled by the `Admin` contract. The same contract has issue with one of it's functions allowing the destruction of `TokenSale` deployment.

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to access control issue, anyone can call `destroyInstance` in the `Admin` contract. The only condition is that the token sale hasn't started yet.

Even though mempool is not publicly available such an attack is still quite possible. The admin contract can be easily found and then, every TokenSale initialization can be followed up and destoyed.

## Impact
Malicious users can backrun every token sale initialization and destroy it.

## Code Snippet
[Admin->destoryInstance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Admin.sol#L138-L143)
```sol
function destroyInstance(
	address _instance
) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) {
    _removeFromSales(_instance);
    ITokenSale(_instance).destroy();
}
```
- No access controls exist making this function callable from anyone.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyAdmin` modifier to the function.
