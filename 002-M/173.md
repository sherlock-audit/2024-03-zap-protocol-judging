# `destroyInstance` in `Admin.sol` lacks proper access control

## Summary

`destroyInstance` in `Admin.sol` doesn't properly check that the caller is an admin, allowing anyone to destroy an instance. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The code looks like this:

```solidity

    function destroyInstance(
        address _instance
    ) external onlyExist(_instance) onlyIncoming(_instance) {
        // @audit: this function doesn't have proper access control
        _removeFromSales(_instance);
        ITokenSale(_instance).destroy();
    }
```

However, because this doesn't check if the caller is an admin or not, anyone can destroy any token sale instance. 

## Impact

Anyone can destroy any token sale instance.
