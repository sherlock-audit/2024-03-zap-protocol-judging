# Admin.sol#destroyInstance Missing access control

## Summary
Missing access control in `destroyInstance()`

## Vulnerability Detail
The `destroyInstance()` is used to destroy a TokenSale contract instance using selfdestruct. It has two modifiers but none of them checks who executes the function, which allows anyone to destroy the TokenSale contract. `destroyInstance()` calls the `destroy()` inside the TokenSale contract and there is a `_onlyAdmin` check which will pass because it is called from the Admin's contract.

## Impact
Anyone to destroy the TokenSale contract
