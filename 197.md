# `block.timestamp = params.privateStart` case is messed up

## Summary

There are a few cases where if admin changes something exactly at `block.timestamp = params.privateStart`, it could lead to issues in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, in `TokenSale.sol`, we find the following code snippet:

```solidity
function setAllocationAndTax(uint256[3] calldata _allocations) external {
        require(block.timestamp <= params.privateStart, "Time lapsed");
```

This is incorrect because at `block.timestamp = params.privateStart`, the sale has already started, and setting the allocation and tax at this point could lead to inconsistencies. 

## Impact
Inconsistencies arise in contract if admin sets these variables exactly at `params.privateStart`
