# Wrongly hard-coded address

## Summary
Wrongly hard-coded address.

## Vulnerability Detail
The address of the USDB token is wrongly hard-coded. The following address, `0xA9F81589Cc48Ff000166Bf03B3804A0d8Cec8114`, is the address of USDB on the Sepolia Testnet network. [link](https://testnet.blastscan.io/token/0xA9F81589Cc48Ff000166Bf03B3804A0d8Cec8114)

The protocol will not work as expected because this address [does not exist](https://blastexplorer.io/address/0xA9F81589Cc48Ff000166Bf03B3804A0d8Cec8114) on the Mainnet, where the smart contract will be deployed.
