# Unsafe Type Casting From `uint128` to `uint120`

## Summary
The function `_claim` in the smart contract contains unsafe type casting which could lead to loss of funds and unexpected behavior under certain conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the type casting of `_s.amount` from `uint128` to `uint120`. When `_s.amount` contains the maximum value that can be represented by `uint128`, casting it to `uint120` can cause unwanted behavior due to overflow.

## Impact
In scenarios where `_s.amount` is close to the maximum value representable by `uint128`, the unsafe type casting could lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior in the smart contract. This could potentially result in financial loss or disruption of intended functionalities.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/TokenSale.sol#L402

```solidity
function _claim(Staked memory _s) internal view returns (uint120, uint256) {
    uint256 left;
    if (state.totalPrivateSold > (state.totalSupplyInValue)) {
        uint256 rate = (state.totalSupplyInValue * PCT_BASE) /
            state.totalPrivateSold;
        _s.share = uint120((uint256(_s.amount) * rate) / PCT_BASE);
        left = uint256(_s.amount) - uint256(_s.share);
    } else {
        _s.share = uint120(_s.amount);      // Unsafe casting
    }

    return (_s.share, left);
}

```

I just wrote this sample contract to prove the behavior:

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.11;

contract TypeCastingTest {
    uint128 private _amount;

    constructor(uint128 amount) {
        _amount = amount;
    }

    function castToUint120() public view returns (uint120) {
        return uint120(_amount);
    }
}

// 340282366920938463463374607431768211455

// 1329227995784915872903807060280344575

```

Try to deploy it with `340282366920938463463374607431768211455` which is the max value of `uint128` and then cast it to `uint120`, you will see that the result will be `1329227995784915872903807060280344575`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to avoid unsafe type casting operations, especially when dealing with values close to the maximum representable range of the source type. Instead, consider using safe arithmetic operations or ensuring that the input values are within a safe range before performing type conversions.
