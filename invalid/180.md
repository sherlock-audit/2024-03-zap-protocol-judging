# `left > 0` check inside `claim` in `TokenSale.sol` leads to unexpected consequences

## Summary



## Vulnerability Detail

We find the following code snippet inside the `claim` function in `TokenSale.sol`:

`require(left > 0, "TokenSale: Nothing to claim");`

Turns out that this has a few bad consequences:

1. The purpose of `s.share` seems to be computing the amount of the token in USDB that users should receive. This is not computed for users where `left = 0`. 
2. Even if `left = 0`, users might be eligible for a tax refund based on the current design (i.e. it seems that users are charged a large amount of tax at the beginning with hardcoded `taxFreeAllc = 0`, and then use the correct value of `taxFreeAllc` in `claim` to issue a tax refund. However, it is possible to have `(taxFreeAllc >= s.share)`, which means you should receive a full tax refund, even if `left = 0`. This means that in this case where `taxFreeAllc >= s.share` but `left = 0`, users are simply not able to claim their tax refund. 

## Impact

1. Users will not have `s.share` computed in the event that `left = 0`
3. Users cannot claim tax refund in certain cases
