# Unsafe casting of sender amount from uint256 to uint128

## Summary
There is an unsafe typecasting from `uint256` to `uint128` in `_processPrivate()`

## Vulnerability Detail
Casting from a larger type `uint256` to a smaller type `uint128` can lead to overflow if the value being cast is larger than what `uint128` can hold. This situation can result in loss of data.

Here `s.amount` is `uint128` and is incremented by `amount` which is `uint256` but unsafely typecasted to `uint128`

```solidity
s.amount += uint128(amount);
```

## Impact
User may receive less than the amount he used as input

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use [OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeCast library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#SafeCast) when casting from uint256 to uint128
