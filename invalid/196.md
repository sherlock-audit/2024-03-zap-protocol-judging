# User can get large allocation without depositing much money

## Summary

User can get large allocation without depositing much money

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_maxTierAllc`, we find the following code specifically for lock level = 4:

```solidity
            nextTierAllc = stakingContract.getAllocations(
                userLockLvl,
                userTier + 1
            );
```

Let's say that user deposits `1 wei` worth of funds at `userLockLvl = 4`. Their tier will be 0 but because of this code they will be allocated tier 1 funds. Therefore, anyone will be able to receive a good amount of allocation without really staking. 

## Impact

anyone will be able to receive a good amount of allocation without really staking
