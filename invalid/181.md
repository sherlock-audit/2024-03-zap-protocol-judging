# Operator using wrong _instance in `Admin::addToBlackList` Whether intentional or unintentional can cause denial-of-service

## Summary
Based on the context, anyone creating a tokensale can be registered as operator for his tokensale instance. Lack of access control for an operator setting his own tokensale instance in `Admin::addToBlackList` can cause denial-of-service. Even worse，the user addresses in blacklist can not be removed.


## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the context, anyone creating a tokensale can be registered as operator for his tokensale instance. Any operator can set any users for any tokensale instance in `Admin::addToBlackList`:
```javascript
function addToBlackList(address _instance, address[] memory _blacklist)
        external
        
        onlyIncoming(_instance)
        onlyExist(_instance)
        onlyRole(OPERATOR)
    {
        require(_blacklist.length <= 500, "TokenSale: Too large array");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _blacklist.length; i++) {
            blacklist[_instance][_blacklist[i]] = true;
        }
    }

```
Proof of Concept:
(1) Alice created a tokensale, then was registered as operator for her tokensale instance
(2) Bob created a tokensale, then was registered as operator for his tokensale instance
(3)Due to competitive relationships or something else, Bob can add a lot of Alice'users in blacklist using  Alice'instance causing a lot of Alice'users can not Unable to participate in Alice'tokensale. Even worse，the user addresses in blacklist can not be removed.

## Impact
The impact for this vulnerability is medium. Operator using wrong _instance in `Admin::addToBlackList` Whether intentional or unintentional can cause denial-of-service. Even worse，the user addresses in blacklist can not be removed.

## Recommendation
(1)Adding access control for an operator can setting his own tokensale instance
(2)Adding function for removing user addresses in blacklist
