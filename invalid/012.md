# Missing token sale duration check

## Summary
Zap Launch is responsible for facilitating permissionless token launches. This means that anyone can call `Admin->createPoolNew` and launch their own IDO. Due to how configuration is checked its possible to end sale the next block and render critical functionality useless.

## Vulnerability Detail
Parameter checks are in place, but the protocol only makes sure that sale start is somewhere in the future and end > start. This is not enough as an IDO issuer can intentionally or by accident make the following troublesome configuration:
```sol
start = block.timestamp
end = block.timestamp + 1
```

With this setup, calling [TokenSaleUSDB->deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-launches-contracts/contracts/TokenSaleUSDB.sol#L150-L168) will fail, because epoch will be Finished. The same is true for `TokenSaleETH->deposit`.


## Impact
While these values are technically valid, they will omit some of the protocol's core functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a `minSaleDuration` parameter in Admin contract. Then modify the param checks in the following way:
```sol
require(
-  _params.saleEnd > _params.saleStart,
+  _params.saleEnd >= _params.saleStart + minSaleDuration,
  "TokenSale: End time > start time"
);
```
