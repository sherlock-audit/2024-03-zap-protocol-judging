# Use `safeTransferFrom` in `createPoolNew` to support non erc20 standard token

## Summary
The `createPoolNew` function use `transferFrom` method for token transfers. It is recommended to replace this with `safeTransferFrom` from the `SafeERC20` library already imported on [Admin.sol#L20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-launches-contracts/contracts/Admin.sol#L20) to ensure additional security checks and prevent potential token transfer issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation uses `IERC20D(_params.tokenAddress).transferFrom`, which does not include the safety checks that `safeTransferFrom` provides. The lack of these checks might lead to unexpected reverts in the case of token transfer failures, especially when interacting with contract tokens that are not ERC20 standard like USDT.

## Impact
Using `transferFrom` without safety checks can lead to scenarios where token transfers fail.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the transferFrom call with safeTransferFrom provided by the SafeERC20 library. This change ensures that any token transfer adheres to the ERC20 standard's safety features, including reversion on failure and execution of custom token logic. The updated line should be:
`IERC20D(_params.tokenAddress).safeTransferFrom`
