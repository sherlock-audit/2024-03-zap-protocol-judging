# Vesting Points Update Mechanism Leads to Missed Claims

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the `claim` and `updateVestingPoints` functions, there exists a logical flaw related to the updating of vesting points by an admin with the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. When vesting points are updated, users who have already claimed some rewards do not have their `index` reset. This oversight means that if new vesting points are added and the `index` of a user is not adjusted accordingly, users may miss out on claiming rewards from newly added vesting points. This is because their claim function iterates from their last claim index, potentially skipping over new vesting points inserted before their next claim index.

## Impact

This flaw can lead to users missing out on vesting rewards they are entitled to, causing unfair distribution of tokens and potentially leading to dissatisfaction and loss of trust among the community.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the claim function logic needs to be revised to ensure it correctly handles the scenario where vesting points are updated after a user has already claimed some points. Specifically:

- Iterate from Start Index Every Time: The claim function should always iterate from the start index (or a relevant adjusted index) to the end for each claim, ensuring no vesting points are missed regardless of updates to the vesting schedule.

- Adjust User Index on Vesting Point Update: Consider adding logic to adjust users' indexes upon the updating of vesting points. This could mean resetting all user indexes in a manner that accounts for the new vesting schedule, though care must be taken to ensure this does not allow for double claiming of rewards.
