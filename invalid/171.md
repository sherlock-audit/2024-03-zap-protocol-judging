# Issue with checking levels in staking contracts allows users to stake at highest level/tier, receive allocation, then unstake

## Summary

The staking contract has an issue where setting yourself to an arbitrary high level isn't prevented. This causes upstream issues with `TokenSale.sol`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The staking contract looks something like this:

`function stake(uint256 _level, uint256 _amount) external payable`

We find the following code inside to compute the duration:

```solidity
uint256 _duration = (block.timestamp + uint256(levels[_level].duration));
```

There is no actual bounds checking to make sure that the _level is actually within range 1-4. 

As a result, you can first stake at an extremely high real level/tier (level = 4, tier = 7 or something), collect your allocation through TokenSale (so just call `deposit` in `TokenSale.sol`), and then change yourself to an arbitrarily high level, which allows you to unstake. The reason changing yourself to an arbitrarily high level allows you to almost immediately unstake is because the `lockTime` will be set to `block.timestamp`, so you only have to wait a block to unstake. You can also do this arbitrarily many times on different accounts, meaning that you can receive the highest level of allocation many times and then immediately unstake and cycle. 

## Impact

Users can receive however much allocation they want at the highest real level/tier, without actually staking anything.
