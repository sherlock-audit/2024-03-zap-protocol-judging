# Unbounded loop in `vestingPoints` can prevent users from being able to `claim()`

## Summary
DOS due to unbounded loop can prevent users from being able to `claim()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users make a claim by calling `claim()`, the contract goes through all vesting points to check to slowly compute the amount that users should receive. 

It is neccessary for the contract to go through all vesting points if this is the user's first claim. Due to this array being unbounded, if the vesting array is set to be too large, users will be DOSed from claiming.

## Impact
Users unable to claim due to DOS.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a hard limit, preferably small value for the amount of vesting points that is used.
