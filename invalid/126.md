# Decimals could be up to 77 on SimpleERC20::constructor

## Summary
SimpleERC20::constructor allows decimals to be up to 77 leading to non standard tokens.   
If decimals is set to 77 and initialSupply is set to 1 then only one token can be minted.  

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists in SimpleERC20::constructor because it doesnt restrict the number of decimals for the SimpleERC20 token   
```js
constructor(
    //...snippet
    uint8 _decimals,        //<@ = 77
    uint256 _initialSupply, //<@ = 1
    address _owner
) ERC20(_name, _symbol) {
    _mint = (owner,1* 10 ** 77) 
    //...snippet
}
// Will call  
ERC20::_mint(owner,  10 ** 77)
```
so after the constructor call totalsupply will be  
```js
ERC20::_totalSupply = 10 ** 77
```  
The max value of ERC20::totalSupply is `2**256-1` because is an uint256 var  
ie:  
```js
2**256-1 / 10**77 = 1.157920892...
```
So, owner will have the only existing token and any further call to mint with X amount  will be converted to less than one token due to decimals ie
```js
X / decimals = X / 10 ** 77
```  
and X will always be less than 10 ** 77  (if not call to mint will overflow).  
So any call to mint after constructor will result in less than 1 token.  
  
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability includes the ability from owner to control the majority of total supply due to contract allowing high decimals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability  it is recommended to limit the decimal value
