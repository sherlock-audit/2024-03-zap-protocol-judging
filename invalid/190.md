# `TokenSale` share is `uint120` while amount is `uint128`

## Summary

In `TokenSale.sol`, the share is casted to a `uint120` while the amount remains a `uint128`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_claim` function in `TokenSale.sol`, we find the following snippet of code:

`_s.share = uint120((uint256(_s.amount) * rate) / PCT_BASE);`

This is incorrect because if `_s.amount` is very large (i.e. lets say 2^127), then the user will receive a much smaller share than they deserve (i.e. they may fully deserve the whole `_s.amount`). This will also lead to issues where the amount actually sold is not close to `totalPrivateSold`.

## Impact

User receives much smaller share than they deserve
