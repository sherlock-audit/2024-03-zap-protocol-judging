# Loss of all funds in `Vesting` contract, by claiming already claimed vesting points

## Summary

`Vesting` can be drained of all assets, due to an integer truncation in [`Vesting.claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L67-L92) that allows users to to claim rewards for already-claimed vesting points.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`Vesting.claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L67-L92) computes the caller's rewards from the their last claim until the latest vesting point.

When saving the user's `index` (the latest point until which they've claimed) back to storage, that counter is downcast to `uint128`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/Vesting.sol#L89

If this truncates the value, the user can simply call `claim()` multiple times to again claim all vesting points from the truncated value up to the current `vestingPoints.length`.

## Impact

Loss of all funds in the `Vesting` contract. Users can drain the contract by repeated calls to `claim()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either
- remove the downcast, or
- declare `vestingPoints` as `uint128[2][]` (if no more than 2^128-1 vesting points are ever expected)
