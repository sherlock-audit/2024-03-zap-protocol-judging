# The attacker can initialize the implementation contract and destroy the contract which leads to DoS

## Summary
The attacker can initialize the implementation contract and destroy the contract which leads to DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
no _disableInitializers in the constructor of TokenSale
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-zap-protocol/blob/main/zap-contracts-labs/contracts/TokenSale.sol#L186

so the attacker can initialize the implementation contract to be the admin and destroy the contract which leads to DoS

## Impact
funds loss, DoS

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function destroy() external override {
        _onlyAdmin();
        uint256 amountUSDC = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (amountUSDC > 0) {
            usdc.safeTransfer(admin.wallet(), amountUSDC);
        }
        address payable wallet = payable(admin.wallet());
        selfdestruct(wallet);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add _disableInitializers  in the constructor of TokenSale and other contracts
