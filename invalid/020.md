# Incorrect implementation determining the share and the amount left in _claim function

## Summary
The function inaccurately calculates both each user's share and the leftover amount post-claiming due to an implementation flaw.

## Vulnerability Detail
The flaw lies in the calculation of each user's rate, which fails to consider individual contributions to the `totalPrivateSold`. Instead, a uniform rate is applied, neglecting variations in users' deposit amounts.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to an unjust distribution of shares, unfairly disadvantaging users who have made larger contributions. Additionally, it may cause inaccuracies in calculating the remaining amount after claiming, posing potential disruptions to the system's integrity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
calculation should look something like this
```solidity
function _claim(Staked memory _s) internal view returns (uint120, uint256) {
    uint256 left;
    if (state.totalPrivateSold > state.totalSupplyInValue) {
        uint256 excessTokens = state.totalPrivateSold - state.totalSupplyInValue;
        uint256 userShare = (_s.amount * excessTokens) / state.totalPrivateSold;
        _s.share = uint120(_s.amount - userShare);
        left = userShare;
    } else {
        _s.share = uint120(_s.amount);
        left = 0; // No tokens left after claiming
    }

    return (_s.share, left);
}

 
```
