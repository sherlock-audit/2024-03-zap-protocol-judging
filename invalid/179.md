# TokenSale.deposit function is not working correctly

## Summary
If the user approves the same amount of tokens as specified in the parameters during deposit, the transaction will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider a small test case:

1)The user calls `usdc.approve(TokenSale, 100e6)`.
2)The user calls the `TokenSale.deposit(100e6)` function, and the transaction fails.

The reason is that the user must approve usdc for the `amount + userTaxAmount` value, so that the transaction does not fail with an "exceeds allowance" issue.

```solidity
if (userTaxAmount > 0) {
            s.taxAmount += userTaxAmount;
            usdc.safeTransferFrom(_sender, marketingWallet, userTaxAmount);
        }
        s.amount += uint128(amount);
        state.totalPrivateSold += uint128(amount);
        usdc.safeTransferFrom(_sender, address(this), amount);
```

## Impact
The transaction will fail if the user approves the same amount of tokens as specified in the parameters during deposit
