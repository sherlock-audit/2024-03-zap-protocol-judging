# Missing unwhitelist functionality

## Summary
Missing unwhitelist functionality on TokenSale.sol contract

## Vulnerability Detail
The TokenSale.sol whitelists users using the `whitelistUser()` which sets the whitelist mapping for that address to true
```solidity
isWhitelisted[users[i]] = true;
```
However, is missing unwhitelisting functionality, meaning if a whitelisted user ends up becoming a malicious user, then the user will never be able to get unwhitelisted.

## Impact
If a user becomes malicious, the malicious user will never be able to get unwhitelisted
